You will notice that the only branches I have committed to are the ones finished with "_solved".

The ones finished with "b" represent the unresolved exercises that I worked with. The ones finished with "e" represent the solution provided by the teacher.

If you want to master JavaScript as a functional programming language, you need to know how to wield advanced techniques, and that means working with functions. In JavaScript, functions are the hidden but secretly powerful bones of your stacks. In this course, author Ray Villalobos explains how functions work, how they're declared, and how you can invoke them more effectively to improve your web applications. Learn about the importance of essential functions like expressions, arguments, scope and hoisting, methods, and return. Along the way, Ray gives you tips on how to get the most out of more advanced features, particularly when you’re working with functions like arrow functions, constructors, recursion, asynchronous functions, and social media links. Be sure to check out the challenge exercises at the end of each section, testing out your new skills with interactive examples and live coding.<br><br>This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace. Check out the [Using GitHub Codespaces with this course][gcs-video-url] video to learn how to get started.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
